_It is not reccomended to use Snapshot versions, as they may contain bugs._

### **NOTE: _OptiFine for Fabric focusFPS_ and _OptiFine for Fabric focusFPS+_ are now unsupported, because of incompatibilities and lack of time updating them. I will add a few of their features to the exesting versions. _OptiFine for Fabric+_ will be unsupported soon in the favor of _Raven Client._**
