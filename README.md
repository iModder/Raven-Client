## **What is this?**
Raven Client is built directly off of my modpack [OptiFine for Fabric](https://modrinth.com/modpack/optifine-for-fabric). It includes **extra features** that are essential for gameplay such as low fire, low shield, no darkness, connecting to **any server version**, and so much more!

## **Why Raven Client instead of others?**
Raven Client is **modular**. This means that it is VERY customizable. Only **essential** mods are enabled by default, and the more game-changing ones are left **disabled**. This allows for a wide range of playstyles, from a **beginner** to Minecraft, to a long time player, to someone switching clients!
Raven Client is also extremely performance focused. When using Raven Client, I get over **2x the FPS** than when using OptiFine!


**Here is how many FPS I get using OptiFine:**
